## Introduction

The world is teeming with educational opportunities across various domains, especially in the technical and digital sectors. Online courses have emerged as a key enabler for learning and skill development, with platforms like Educative providing a wealth of high-quality courses.

However, navigating this vast sea of educational content can be overwhelming. That's where this project comes in. We're creating a user-friendly, community-driven database to catalog and curate these educational gems. The aim is to make it easier for learners, whether beginners or experts, to discover and access courses that align with their interests and ambitions.

This is a part of an educative course database being built as part of Hacktoberfest 2023. Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.MD](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.
